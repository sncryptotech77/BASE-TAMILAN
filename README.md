CRYPTO IS NOT HERE TO STAY
Base Chain, often called Base, is an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) blockchain developed by Coinbase, launched in 2023 as a fully permissionless, low-cost scaling solution.

It leverages Optimism's OP Stack for optimistic rollups, enabling fast transactions with fees under a penny while inheriting Ethereum's security through fraud proofs.

Popular for DeFi apps, NFTs, and meme coins, Base has grown rapidly, hitting over 10 million daily active addresses by mid-2025 and bridging billions in TVL.
Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger.
It records transactions across multiple computers.
No single entity controls the entire network.
Transactions are grouped into blocks.
Each block links to the previous one.
This forms a chronological chain.
